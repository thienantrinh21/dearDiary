# dearDiary
Dear Diary is a diary website where a user can write down their thoughts wherever they are. 
These days it is important to take some time out of your busy schedule of juggling work, family/friends, and other obligations. 
Mental health is a huge topic discussed these days and I have found that just the act of writing down what I am feeling is a huge stress relief for dealing with the pressures of being a college student.

Dear Diary uses handlebars for its front end and Node(Express) for the backend. The database used for this site is MongoDB(mlab) and is set to be completed by the end of February 2019!
